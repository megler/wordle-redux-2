## Question

Which seems better for creating the elements of the app: JS alone or JS with React?

JS with React is much more concise and easier to write compared to JS alone. I believe it's easier to read as well - at least on a small scale. However, I dislike that there is no separation of concerns. Your CSS/HTML feels far more intermingled with your JS than it does in Angular.

Update to last week: Having now converted this into JSX, I do like the readability of the code compared to straight JS. I still would prefer separation of concerns, but if I had to pick between JS and JSX, I would use JSX.
